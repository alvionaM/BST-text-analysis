“What's today?” cried Scrooge, calling downward to a boy in Sunday clothes, who perhaps had loitered in to look about him.

“Eh?” returned the boy with all his might of wonder.

“What's today, my fine fellow?” said Scrooge.

“Today!” replied the boy. “Why, Christmas day.”

“It's Christmas day!” said Scrooge to himself. “I haven't missed it. The spirits have done it all in one night. They can do anything they like. Of course they can. Of course they can. Hallo, my fine fellow!”

“Hallo!” returned the boy.

“Do you know the poulterer's in the next street but one, at the corner?” Scrooge inquired.

“I should hope I did,” replied the la2d.
